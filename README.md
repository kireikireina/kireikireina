### TMI
â–· Just another ordinary weeb chasing her computer science degree at Satya Wacana Christian University, Salatiga, Indonesia~ (although that i stated there that I'm a weeb, Kireina IS my real name, not an alias).

â–· Fluent in both Indonesian and English, understand Javanese and Japanese to a certain level :)

â–· A shameless kendoka who'd tell everyone she barely met about her ((almost)) 7 years of kendo career, despite the fact that she has never achieve anything up to this point.

### Why am I even here??
I honestly don't know how does this platform work, one of my lecturer told me to be here, so here I am! (lol)

I'm always looking for ways to improve, though! Please look after me <3
